Some solutions to the algorithm challenges

- Solutions try to follow constraints set by book as much as possible (might not be reasonable in practice)
- Weekend Challenges are not included because quite a few are open-ended
- ByWeek is what our cohort did each week, may differ from book constraints
- Feel free to contact me with better solutions or to ask me to comment a solution more
